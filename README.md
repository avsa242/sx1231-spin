# sx1231-spin 
-------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller driver object for the Semtech SX1231 UHF Transceiver (SPI)

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* SPI connection at up to 1MHz (P1), 10MHz (P2)
* Set on-air bitrate
* Set carrier center freq
* Set carrier deviation freq
* Set modulation type
* Set transmit power
* Set number of preamble bytes
* Set packet length
* Set syncword (and length of)
* Enable and read on-chip low-battery status
* Address matching/filtering (including broadcast)
* CRC generation/checking
* Data whitening or Manchester encoding (untested)
* Encryption (untested)
* Configure GPIO (DIO0..5) functionality

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* 1 extra core/cog for the PASM SPI engine

P2/SPIN2:
* p2-spin-standard-library

| P2        | SPIN2    | FlexSpin (5.9.14-beta) | Native code | OK                    |
| P1        | SPIN1    | Brad's Spin Tool (any) | Bytecode    | Unsupported           |
| P1, P2    | SPIN1, 2 | Propeller Tool (any)   | Bytecode    | Unsupported           |
| P1, P2    | SPIN1, 2 | PNut (any)             | Bytecode    | Unsupported           |

## Limitations

* Because of the max length of the syncword supported by the chip (8 bytes/64bits), the API for SyncWord() currently breaks the standard, by providing two parameters
